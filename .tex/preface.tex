This is a set of solutions to the exercises in Chapter 1, Sections 1 through 11 of the book "Topology, 2nd Edition" by James Munkres.

All statements of the exercises in this doc are borrowed from the book, and the solutions are taken from my old TeX note written around 2010 when I was an undergraduate student. At the time of writing, unfortunately, these solutions have not undergone reliable review. Therefore, they should be examined by the readers themselves. Any suggestions for improvements would be appreciated.
